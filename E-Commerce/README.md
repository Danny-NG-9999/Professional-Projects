# üõí Strategic BI Analysis of the Brazilian E-Commerce Platform

## Project Background
This project presents a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) analysis of the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist, one of Brazil‚Äôs leading online retail platforms. Olist connects thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with customers nationwide, offering a rich dataset for analyzing sales performance, customer behavior, seller operations, and logistics efficiency.

The dataset comprises over 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018, encompassing detailed transactional data such as order status, pricing, payment methods, freight performance, customer demographics, product attributes, and customer reviews. It also includes geolocation data linking Brazilian ZIP codes to latitude and longitude coordinates, enabling granular regional and demographic analysis. All records have been anonymized to protect both customer and business identities.

Using Power BI, Python, and MySQL, the dataset was systematically cleaned, transformed, modeled, and visualized to create interactive dashboards and derive actionable insights. The analytical workflow followed an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, incorporating:
1. Data extraction and validation
2. Data cleaning and transformation
3. SQL-based exploration and modeling
4. Comprehensive analysis and interactive reporting

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate Olist‚Äôs operational performance and uncover actionable opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction, sales efficiency, and logistical effectiveness. Insights derived from the analysis are categorized into four strategic focus areas:
- ‚öôÔ∏è Operational Performance ‚Äì Analysis of sales trends, order volumes, top-performing categories, and purchasing behavior.
- üöö Logistics Performance ‚Äì Evaluation of payment patterns, delivery timelines, monthly variance, and shipping reliability.
- ‚≠ê Customer Reviews ‚Äì Exploration of sentiment patterns and key drivers influencing satisfaction and dissatisfaction.
- üí∞ Lead Conversion ‚Äì Assessment of marketing funnel efficiency, from qualified leads to closed conversions.

Through this BI-driven approach, the project transforms raw transactional data into strategic business intelligence, empowering data-informed decision-making and revealing pathways to strengthen Olist‚Äôs sales growth, customer experience, and competitive positioning in the Brazilian e-commerce landscape.

## Data structure & Initial check
The Olist E-Commerce Database is a comprehensive relational dataset that provides a complete view of the transaction lifecycle within the Olist online marketplace ecosystem. This schema is meticulously designed to capture the entire ecosystem, from initial customer contact and order placement to final delivery and review, enabling deep analytical insights into business performance, customer behavior, and marketplace dynamics. 

This dataset contains over 100,000 orders placed by approximately 99,000 unique customers and fulfilled by nearly 3,100 active sellers, covering the period from 2016 to 2018. It comprises 11 core tables and one custom-enriched table (`brazil_states`), which together enable the detailed analysis across geographical, operational, and commercial dimensions. The tables are logically interconnected to represent the e-commerce funnel and operational workflow within the Olist platform. 

The **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and detailed table descriptions are provided below for reference.

## Executive Summary and Key Takeaways
This comprehensive analysis of Olist‚Äôs Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset‚Äîspanning 100,000+ orders from 2016 to 2018‚Äîreveals a marketplace characterized by rapid growth but constrained by logistical inefficiencies and customer retention gaps. After rigorous data cleaning and transformation, the refined dataset includes:
- 96,100 unique customers
- 3,100 active sellers
- ~99,500 orders ready for deep analysis

The analysis uncovers actionable patterns in sales performance, customer behavior, and market dynamics, offering a data-driven roadmap to optimize operational efficiency and elevate customer satisfaction. Below are the strategic takeaways:
- Growth Trajectory: Strong upward momentum in order volume and revenue, signaling market expansion opportunities.
- Logistical Bottlenecks: Persistent delays and inefficiencies in order fulfillment, risking customer trust and repeat business.
- Customer Retention: High churn rates among first-time buyers, highlighting the need for targeted engagement and loyalty initiatives.
- Lead Conversion: Digital acquisition channels ‚Äî particularly organic search, paid search, and direct traffic ‚Äî drive strong funnel performance, though there remains significant potential to optimize conversion rates and enhance overall marketing efficiency.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Operational Performance
- Growth & Seasonality: Olist exhibits steady year-over-year growth, with highly predictable, pronounced sales peaks during the Christmas season. This confirms the need for proactive, seasonal inventory planning.
- Market Concentration: Sales volume is heavily concentrated in major metropolitan areas, particularly S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, confirming that geographic optimization and logistics density in these hubs is key to maximizing revenue.

Product Strategy: The "Health and Beauty" category leads in overall volume. Furthermore, we identified strong cross-selling opportunities between niche categories like "Garden Tools" and "Computer Accessories," suggesting immediate potential for high-margin bundled promotions and targeted inventory investment in fast-growing segments.

üöö Logistics Performance
Primary Bottleneck: The analysis confirmed that shipping delays are the single greatest driver of negative customer reviews and low satisfaction scores. Addressing delivery consistency is mandatory for improving Customer Satisfaction (CSAT).

Fulfillment Variability: Delivery timelines show significant variability across regions and are occasionally impacted by external factors (e.g., postal strikes), necessitating better communication and dynamic estimated delivery date (EDD) management.

Seller Efficiency: A key operational insight is that the marketplace's smaller sellers demonstrate slightly faster shipping times on average than larger sellers. This suggests an opportunity to formalize best practices from the small seller cohort and scale them across the entire seller ecosystem.

‚≠ê Customer Reviews
Satisfaction Driver: Despite the negative impact of shipping issues, the majority of overall sentiment remains positive.

Retention Challenge: A critical finding is the low rate of repeat customers, indicating a substantial challenge in retention and a large gap in realizing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

Behavioral Window: Customers are statistically more likely to place orders at the beginning of the working week (Monday/Tuesday), providing an ideal window for targeted retention and promotional campaigns.

üí∞ Lead Conversion (Seller Acquisition)
Channel Confirmation: The primary, successful channels driving seller acquisition for the Olist marketplace are organic search, paid search, and direct traffic. This confirms the current marketing focus areas are effective for filling the top of the seller funnel.
