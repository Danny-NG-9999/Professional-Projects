# üõí Strategic BI Analysis of the Brazilian E-Commerce Platform

## Project Background
This project presents a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) analysis of the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist, one of Brazil‚Äôs leading online retail platforms. Olist connects thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with customers nationwide, offering a rich dataset for analyzing sales performance, customer behavior, seller operations, and logistics efficiency.

The dataset comprises over 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018, encompassing detailed transactional data such as order status, pricing, payment methods, freight performance, customer demographics, product attributes, and customer reviews. It also includes geolocation data linking Brazilian ZIP codes to latitude and longitude coordinates, enabling granular regional and demographic analysis. All records have been anonymized to protect both customer and business identities.

Using Power BI, Python, and MySQL, the dataset was systematically cleaned, transformed, modeled, and visualized to create interactive dashboards and derive actionable insights. The analytical workflow followed an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, incorporating:
1. Data extraction and validation
2. Data cleaning and transformation
3. SQL-based exploration and modeling
4. Comprehensive analysis and interactive reporting

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate Olist‚Äôs operational performance and uncover actionable opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction, sales efficiency, and logistical effectiveness. Insights derived from the analysis are categorized into four strategic focus areas:
- ‚öôÔ∏è Operational Performance ‚Äì Analysis of sales trends, order volumes, top-performing categories, and purchasing behavior.
- üöö Logistics Performance ‚Äì Evaluation of payment patterns, delivery timelines, monthly variance, and shipping reliability.
- ‚≠ê Customer Reviews ‚Äì Exploration of sentiment patterns and key drivers influencing satisfaction and dissatisfaction.
- üí∞ Lead Conversion ‚Äì Assessment of marketing funnel efficiency, from qualified leads to closed conversions.

Through this BI-driven approach, the project transforms raw transactional data into strategic business intelligence, empowering data-informed decision-making and revealing pathways to strengthen Olist‚Äôs sales growth, customer experience, and competitive positioning in the Brazilian e-commerce landscape.

- Weekend Activation Strategies: Launch weekend-exclusive incentives such as free shipping on Saturdays or bundle offers to boost weekend conversion rates and offset the activity gap.
- Operational Optimization: Align warehouse staffing and customer support coverage with the 10:00‚Äì22:00 activity window to improve fulfillment speed and reduce processing backlogs.

#### Geospatial Distribution: Customer and Revenue Concentration
- Customer Distribution: The majority of Olist‚Äôs customer base is concentrated in Southeastern Brazil, particularly S√£o Paulo (SP), Minas Gerais (MG), and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) ‚Äî collectively representing the platform‚Äôs largest and most active customer clusters. In contrast, Northern regions (e.g., Amazonas, AM) show minimal customer penetration, highlighting untapped market potential.
- Revenue Distribution: Revenue closely follows customer density, with SP, MG, and RJ generating the highest total sales. However, average revenue per customer varies regionally, suggesting differing purchasing power and product mix preferences that warrant localized pricing strategies.
- Regional Disparities: The Southeast region dominates in both order volume and revenue contribution, while Northern and Central-Western states (e.g., Acre, AC) remain largely underdeveloped in e-commerce activity, underscoring an opportunity for strategic regional expansion.

**üí° Actionable Insights and Recommendation:**
- Revenue Optimization: Conduct regional A/B testing in high-value markets (SP and RJ) to optimize Average Order Value (AOV) through dynamic pricing and bundled offers that aligning offers with local purchasing behavior.
- Dual Fulfillment Strategy (SP/RJ vs. Rest of Brazil):
  - High-Volume Corridor: Perform a feasibility study for opening a regional fulfillment hub or cross-docking center specifically dedicated to serving the S√£o Paulo/Rio de Janeiro corridor. This dedicated infrastructure could cut intra-state delivery times by multiple days, transforming the customer experience.
  - Long-Tail Coverage: For the remaining fragmented, low-volume geographical regions, maintain a low-CAPEX, decentralized logistics strategy. Avoid capital over-investment and instead leverage strategic partnerships with strong, regional carriers to cost-effectively manage the long-tail geographical spread.

### Logistics Performance
<img width="2224" height="1254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e42cd28e-0014-4657-9ec0-1656e5b3bc93" />

#### Order Status and Payment Types breakdown
- Performance Overview: Olist demonstrates a low overall cancellation and others rate, indicating operational reliability and customer trust. However, even marginal improvements in order completion could yield a revenue uplift of approximately $312K, based on current gross sales of $15.64M. This underscores the financial leverage of process optimization in order management.
- Improvement Potential: A deeper analysis suggests that cancellations often correlate with late dispatches, unclear product information, or stock inaccuracies, all of which can be mitigated through better operational control and transparency.
- Credit Card ‚Äì Dominant Channel: The majority of transactions are completed via credit cards, underscoring Brazilian consumers‚Äô strong preference for installment-based payments and ease of online use.
- Boleto Banc√°rio ‚Äì Significant Local Method: A substantial share of payments are made through Boleto, reflecting the continued relevance of traditional and locally trusted payment systems, especially among unbanked or credit-averse customers.
- Debit Card & Other Methods ‚Äì Limited Adoption: Debit cards and alternative payment methods represent a small fraction of total transactions.

**üí° Actionable Insights and Recommendation:**
- Seller-Level Monitoring: Implement a real-time cancellation dashboard segmented by seller and product category. Flag sellers exceeding a 2% cancellation rate for immediate review and targeted operational support to preserve marketplace consistency.
- Pre-Purchase Clarity: Enhance product page transparency by standardizing descriptions, ensuring accurate stock visibility, and providing dynamic estimated delivery times (EDD). This will help reduce pre-purchase uncertainty ‚Äî a key driver of preventable cancellations.

#### Delivery Status, Processing - Shipping duration and Delivery variance Breakdown
- Seller-Driven Delays: Over 10,000 late dispatches were attributed to seller-side inefficiencies, which can be primarily driven by inventory mismanagement (e.g., stockouts or inaccurate listings) or inefficient packaging workflows (e.g., manual processes and limited automation) or suboptimal order prioritization, such as delays in processing high-volume orders, highlighting the need for deeper analysis and improved seller communication to identify the true root causes.
- Processing vs. Handoff Gap: While order processing is efficient (averaging 0.43 hours), a 2.8-day delay before carrier handoff highlights a significant operational bottleneck at the seller level.
- Business Impact: Extended delivery timelines are strongly associated with reduced customer satisfaction, lower repeat purchase rates, and a competitive disadvantage in the fast-paced e-commerce environment.
- Delivery Variance: Orders generally arrive earlier than scheduled, with an average lead time of up to 16 days in July, indicating a positive variance. However, this inconsistency demonstrates a misalignment between scheduled and actual delivery performance, where occasional severe delays undermine overall delivery reliability.

**üí° Actionable Insights and Recommendation:**
- Predictive Delivery Promise Engine: Utilize machine learning to generate accurate and dynamic delivery estimates, improving customer trust and satisfaction. The model should incorporates seller performance history, carrier reliability, and seasonal demand patterns to enhance predictive accuracy.
- Carrier Performance Evaluation: Assess current carriers using regional delivery data and historical performance metrics to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement.
- Multi-Carrier Strategy: Develop a diverse and flexible carrier network to mitigate risks associated with single-provider dependency and ensure consistent delivery reliability.
- Dynamic Carrier Routing: Implement a data-driven routing system that selects carriers based on destination, seasonal demand, and past performance, optimizing both delivery speed and cost-efficiency.


#### Correlation Matrix between top performing product category
- Weak Inter-Category Correlation: The correlation matrix for Olist‚Äôs top five categories (Auto, Computers & Accessories, Furniture & Decor, Health & Beauty, Sports & Leisure) shows minimal correlation, indicating that purchases in one category are largely independent of others. This pattern suggests category-specific purchasing behavior, with buyers focused on specific needs rather than exploratory or impulse shopping across categories.
- Limited Cross-Selling Potential: Customers predominantly focus on specific product categories, with little multi-category purchasing observed, reducing opportunities to increase AOV through broad cross-category promotions.
- Category-Focused Growth Opportunities: Revenue growth is more likely to come from within-category engagement, such as personalized recommendations, sub-category bundling, and targeted promotions aligned with customer preferences.

**üí° Actionable Insights and Recommendation:**
- Targeted Cross-Promotions Within Categories: Focus on sub-category bundling (e.g., complementary products within Health & Beauty or Computers & Accessories) rather than broad cross-category bundles, where correlation is weak.
- Personalized Recommendation Engine: Implement machine learning-driven product recommendations tailored to each customer‚Äôs purchasing history, which can help identify latent cross-selling patterns not visible in aggregate correlations.

### Customer Reviews
<img width="2120" height="1194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2178e38-d4b7-4419-ba6f-a5a4c24cec29" />

#### Top Drivers of Dissatisfaction (Word Cloud)
Analysis of negative customer reviews, visualized via a word cloud, highlights recurring complaints that can be grouped into three primary issues:
1. Logistics Failures:
- Predominant driver of negative sentiment, with frequent mentions of delivery delays or missing orders.
- Common terms include produto n√£o recebi (product not received), demora (delay), n√£o chegou (did not arrive), and ainda n√£o (still not).
- Indicates that timely and reliable fulfillment remains the most critical factor affecting customer satisfaction.

2. Product Mismatches:
- Complaints related to items not matching descriptions or images.
- While present, these issues are significantly less frequent than logistics-related complaints, suggesting a secondary impact on overall sentiment.

3. Quality Issues:
- Reports of defective, damaged, or counterfeit products appear in reviews, highlighting occasional gaps in product quality control.

**üí° Actionable Insights and Recommendation:**
- Logistics Optimization: Partner with reliable carriers, implement real-time shipment tracking, and proactively communicate delays. Offer compensation incentives (e.g., discounts on future purchases) to maintain customer trust and satisfaction.
- Product Listing Standards: Enforce high-quality product images and comprehensive descriptions (dimensions, materials, specifications). Flag sellers with high mismatch or error rates for review to ensure consistent product quality and reduce order issues.
- Post-Purchase Support: Automate customer follow-ups (e.g., ‚ÄúDid your order meet expectations?‚Äù) to identify and resolve issues early. Streamline returns and refunds processes for defective or unsatisfactory items to enhance the overall post-purchase experience.

#### Review Volume and Sentiment Over Time
- Positive Sentiment Stability: Despite fluctuations in order volume, the majority of customers consistently award 4- and 5-star ratings, indicating strong satisfaction when products are delivered on time and as described. This resilience underscores Olist‚Äôs ability to meet expectations under normal operating conditions.
- Seasonal Impact: Noticeable dips in sentiment during high-volume months‚Äînotably March and August‚Äîsuggest that logistics strain during promotional or holiday periods leads to delivery delays and increased low ratings. The December slowdown shows some improvement, but recurring negative feedback points to persistent operational bottleneck

**üí° Actionable Insights and Recommendation:**
- Root Cause Diagnostics: Conduct targeted failure analyses for the March and August review dips to identify logistics or fulfillment weaknesses. Use findings to stress-test and reinforce delivery infrastructure ahead of peak demand cycles.
- 3-Star Recovery Program: Focus on converting neutral (3-star) customers‚Äîwho represent a major ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù segment‚Äîinto promoters through personalized post-purchase engagement, proactive support, and retention-driven incentives (e.g., discounts on next purchase). This initiative can directly improve repeat purchase rates and overall customer lifetime value (CLV).

#### Top 10 Categories with Bad Reviews
- High-Volume, High-Risk Categories: Categories such as Health & Beauty and Sports & Leisure generate substantial sales and naturally attract a higher number of negative reviews. This correlation is typical of high-volume segments, where larger order volumes increase exposure to customer dissatisfaction.
- Disproportionate Risk Zones: Categories like Bed, Bath & Table, Furniture & Decor, and Computers & Accessories are overrepresented in the ‚ÄúBad Reviews‚Äù treemap. These items are typically large, fragile, or technically complex, making them more susceptible to fulfillment issues, damage during transit, or mismatched customer expectations.
- Quality Control Gaps: The concentration of poor reviews in high-touch categories (e.g., Furniture, Electronics) highlights potential seller quality control deficiencies and inadequate packaging standards, signaling a need for stricter operational governance in product handling and delivery.

**üí° Actionable Insights and Recommendation:**
- Enforce Packaging Compliance: Introduce mandatory packaging standards (e.g., reinforced boxing, protective padding) for high-risk categories such as Furniture & Decor, Bed, Bath & Table, and Computers & Accessories. Tie compliance to seller performance scores and marketplace visibility.
- Category-Specific Seller Management: Establish tiered seller vetting and monitoring based on product risk profile. For fragile or high-value goods, enforce stricter review thresholds, faster delivery SLAs, and periodic performance audits.
- Feedback Integration Loop: Implement a closed feedback mechanism requiring category managers to review all 1- and 2-star reviews monthly. Insights should feed directly into product improvement, listing accuracy updates, and seller coaching programs to prevent recurring quality issues.
