## Project Background
In this project, I have analyzed the data provided and make a dashboard using the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist. Also, I have looked into the company's store performance to bring insights on opportunity to improve overall customer satisfaction.

In our exploration of the Olist dataset, we have uncovered several insights into the company’s operations. We observed that Olist experienced steady growth over the period covered by the dataset, with a significant increase in sales around Christmas. Sales trends showed that certain product categories are growing much faster than others. Purchasing patterns indicate that customers are more likely to place orders at the start of the week. The bulk of sales is concentrated in populous cities, particularly São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Shipping durations vary significantly across different cities and are sometimes affected by postal strikes. Despite many positive reviews, there are frequent complaints about shipping delays. Most orders are of low value, though there is considerable variation in the costs of orders. The most popular product category is "Health and Beauty". The dataset includes very few repeat customers. There some products that are frequently bought together, especially in the categories "Garden Tools" and "Computer Accessories". Most of Olist’s sellers are small businesses, and these generally have slightly faster shipping times than larger sellers. The key channels for acquiring sellers for Olist include organic search, paid search, and direct traffic.

# About the Dataset
The dataset has information on 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. The orders include details such as order status, price, payment, freight performance to customer location, product attribute, and reviews written by customers. The geolocation data is associated to Brazilian zip codes with latitude and longitude coordinates.

This is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced.

# Software Used
- Microsoft Power BI
- Python
- MySQL


The dataset has been loaded and processed in the Power Query Editor and MySQL. In order to facilitate better recognition, I had to promote headers for most of the dataset since Power Query initially struggled to identify them. Additionally, I adjusted the data types for many entries. To enhance clarity and user-friendliness, I replaced technical jargon with more understandable terms, particularly in the "product_category_name_translation" file.
