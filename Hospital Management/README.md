# üè• Hospital Operations Performance Analysis (India, 2023)
## Project background
This project aim to delivers a comprehensive operational performance analysis of a multi-branch hospital network in India, consisting of Central Hospital, Eastside Clinic, and Westside Clinic. he dataset, sourced from Kaggle, covers the year 2023 and spans key operational dimensions ‚Äî appointments, billing, treatments, doctors, and patients.

Despite having accumulated a wealth of operational data, the hospital network had not systematically leveraged it for performance optimization or strategic planning. This project was designed to transform that underutilized data into actionable intelligence ‚Äî enabling data-driven decisions to enhance efficiency, financial outcomes, and patient experience.

Through end-to-end data analysis processes, including data extraction, cleaning, SQL-based exploration, and interactive visualization in Power BI, the analysis uncovers core performance gaps and improvement opportunities.
The resulting insights inform strategic recommendations across three critical areas:
- Operational efficiency ‚Äì improving appointment completion and reducing no-shows.
- Financial performance ‚Äì optimizing revenue realization and cash flow.
- Resource utilization ‚Äì balancing doctor workloads and enhancing service delivery.

## Executive Summary and Key Takeaways
This project analyzes the 2023 operational performance of a multi-branch hospital system in India, aiming to uncover actionable insights that enhance efficiency, financial health, and patient service quality.
The study integrates appointment, billing, treatment, and doctor performance data across Central Hospital, Eastside Clinic, and Westside Clinic, highlighting key challenges in appointment reliability, revenue conversion, and workforce utilization.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Appointment Performance & Patient Behavior

Appointment management stands out as a major operational bottleneck. Of the 200 appointments recorded, only 23% were successfully completed, while more than 51.5% were either cancelled or missed (no-shows) ‚Äî a clear indicator of underutilized clinical capacity and inefficient scheduling processes.

A closer examination shows that consultations, therapy sessions, and follow-up visits account for nearly two-thirds (65%) of all cancellations or no-shows, highlighting recurring issues in routine and non-urgent appointments. Moreover, 33.15% of these missed or cancelled visits were paid for in advance, creating both a financial exposure risk and a potential source of patient dissatisfaction if refunds or rescheduling are not managed promptly and transparently.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue & Collection Efficiency

An analysis of billing and collection patterns reveals strong disparities across branches and payment methods.
- Central Hospital leads performance with the highest realized revenue and a cash conversion rate of 1.14, reflecting robust billing discipline and effective front-desk collection practices.
- Eastside Clinic shows moderate consistency (conversion 0.51‚Äì0.97) but room for improvement in cash reconciliation.
- Westside Clinic underperforms, with conversion rates below 0.5 for several payment modes, suggesting delays in claim processing and weak financial follow-up.

Across payment types, cash remains the most reliable and liquid revenue stream (conversion 0.83), while insurance (0.70) and credit cards (0.56) introduce cash flow delays due to external dependencies and processing lags.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Doctor Utilization & Workforce Efficiency

- Doctor performance analysis reveals uneven utilization across branches and specialties. Central Hospital leads in workload but faces notable no-shows and cancellation leakage, Eastside Clinic maintains steady engagement, while Westside Clinic suffers from chronic underutilization and patient disengagement.
- Treatment trends show the highest no-show rates in Physiotherapy and Chemotherapy (elective and long-duration treatments), whereas ECG and MRI maintain the strongest attendance due to their diagnostic urgency.
- Across experience levels, mid-career doctors (17‚Äì24 years) demonstrate the most consistent patient engagement, outperforming both senior and junior colleagues‚Äîhighlighting that experience alone does not guarantee efficiency, but adaptability and proactive communication do.

### üéØ Overall Insight & Opportunities
The hospital‚Äôs operational challenges stem from three interconnected inefficiencies:
- High appointment attrition, leading to underutilized clinical capacity.
- Delayed revenue realization from non-cash payment channels.
- Uneven doctor utilization, reducing patient throughput and service efficiency.

To address these issues and drive sustainable operational improvement, the hospital should adopt the following strategic approaches:
- Enhance Patient Flow Management ‚Äî Implement automated reminders, flexible rescheduling, and proactive engagement to significantly reduce cancellations and no-shows.
- Standardize Financial Operations ‚Äî Replicate Central Hospital‚Äôs best-in-class billing and collection practices across all branches to strengthen revenue cycle management and cash flow consistency.
- Optimize Clinical Scheduling ‚Äî Use data-driven insights to rebalance doctor workloads, align treatment demand with capacity, and improve overall staff productivity.

## Deep Dive Analysis
### Appointment Data
The appointment data reveals a significant imbalance in visit outcomes, signaling both operational inefficiency and patient management challenges.

| Appointment Outcome  | Percentage | 
| -------------------- | ---------- | 
| Completed            | **23.0%**  | 
| Cancelled            | **25.5%**  | 
| No-show              | **26.0%**  | 
| Scheduled (upcoming) | **25.5%**  |

In total, 51.5% of all appointments were either cancelled or missed, representing a substantial attrition rate and inefficient resource utilization.
A deeper look shows that the majority of missed appointments originate from consultations, therapy, and follow-up visits (67 out of 103 cases) ‚Äî appointment types typically considered non-urgent or easily deferrable by patients.

From a financial standpoint, 33.15% of cancelled or no-show appointments were prepaid, revealing a disconnect between financial collection and service fulfillment. This not only ties up revenue in refunds or credits but also risks patient dissatisfaction if reimbursement processes lack transparency or timeliness.

üí° Key Insights:
- The current appointment management framework is reactive, lacking proactive engagement and recovery mechanisms to minimize cancellations and no-shows.
- Lower-acuity visits (consultations, therapy, and follow-ups) exhibit the highest attrition, indicating the need for scheduling and reminder strategies.

‚öôÔ∏è Recommended Actions:
1. Implement proactive patient engagement systems
- Introduce automated SMS/email reminders and in-app confirmations for upcoming visits.
- Allow patients to self-reschedule via digital channels rather than cancel outright.
- Personalize reminders based on appointment type (e.g., therapy) to improve show-up rates.

2. Adopt real-time slot optimization
- Deploy an automated slot backfilling mechanism to reassign cancelled or missed appointments to waiting patients.
- Prioritize high-demand treatments (e.g., MRI, ECG) to maximize capacity utilization.

3. Align financial and operational workflows
- Integrate billing data with appointment status to automatically trigger refunds, credits, or reschedules for prepaid but unfulfilled appointments.
- Establish a clear refund turnaround SLA to maintain patient trust.
- Introduce a centralized financial reconciliation dashboard to monitor prepaid and unserved appointments in real time.

### Revenue Conversion & Financial Efficiency

**Payment Method Efficiency**

Despite non-cash channels (credit card and insurance) representing nearly 70% of total billed revenue, they are the slowest to convert into available cash, leading to working capital friction and reduced reinvestment capacity.


| Payment Method  | Total Paid (¬£) | Realized Revenue (¬£) | Potential Revenue (¬£) | Conversion Rate | Interpretation                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cash**        | 52,691.30      | 23,111.72            | 40,051.96             | **0.83**        | The most reliable and liquid payment channel with minimal processing delays; strong front-end collection.               |
| **Credit Card** | 60,377.11      | 61,435.22            | 45,730.88             | **0.56**        | Generates the highest transaction volume but experiences slower realization due to settlement lags and processing fees. |
| **Insurance**   | 60,356.49      | 39,553.52            | 46,643.86             | **0.70**        | Moderate performance constrained by claim approval timelines and administrative bottlenecks.                            |



**Branch level performance**

The branch-level analysis reveals notable disparities in revenue realization (realized + potentential realized) and cash conversion efficiency across the hospital network. While all three branches contribute significantly to total revenue, their collection consistency and financial discipline vary sharply by payment type.
Central Hospital leads overall in financial strength, driven by effective insurance and cash management. Eastside Clinic performs steadily but lacks uniformity across channels, while Westside Clinic continues to underperform across all payment methods, signaling systemic inefficiencies in cash flow management and claim follow-up.


| **Branch**           | **Cash** | **Insurance** | **Credit Card** | **Key Interpretation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Central Hospital** | **0.91** | **1.14**      | **0.51**        | **Strong but Uneven Performer.** Central Hospital sets the financial benchmark with the **highest overall conversion efficiency** among all branches. Exceptional insurance realization (114%) indicates effective **advance billing and claims processing**, while cash transactions remain strong (91%), reflecting well-managed front-desk collections. However, a notably weaker credit card conversion (51%) suggests potential inefficiencies in **digital payment reconciliation** or **settlement delays**, which should be addressed to achieve balanced revenue performance across payment channels. |
| **Eastside Clinic**  | **0.97** | **0.56**      | **0.49**        | **Operationally Inconsistent.** Eastside Clinic demonstrates **excellent cash management** (97%), showing disciplined front-line collection practices. Yet, lower performance in insurance (56%) and credit card transactions (49%) reveals dependence on immediate cash payments and challenges in managing **external claims and digital settlements**. This uneven profile highlights the need for **stronger back-office coordination** and **claim follow-up automation** to capture delayed or unprocessed revenue.                                                                                      |
| **Westside Clinic**  | **0.37** | **0.32**      | **0.63**        | **Underperforming Branch with Systemic Gaps.** Westside Clinic exhibits severe underperformance in cash (37%) and insurance (32%) conversion, indicating major gaps in billing oversight, claim management, and reconciliation control. While credit card conversion (63%) is notably higher, it alone fails to offset the systemic weaknesses observed in other payment channels. The data points to a breakdown in operational discipline across both front-desk and administrative functions, necessitating immediate corrective action, staff retraining, and stronger accountability frameworks to mitigate ongoing revenue leakage. |
